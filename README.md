My digital outcome is a stake pool on the Cardano blockchain network. The Cardano blockchain network is a collection of interconnected nodes—known as stake pools—that work collaboratively to validate transactions and produce blocks. The production of these blocks grow the network, and in return for block propagation, stake pools receive rewards in the form of ADA (Cardano’s cryptocurrency).

My stake pool is a network in itself, and consists of two servers; the Relay node and the Block Producer node. The Block Producer node is responsible for undertaking transactions and block propagation—thus in turn, securing the Cardano blockchain—whilst the Relay node is responsible for linking the Block Producer node to the wider Cardano network in a safe and secure way.

The purpose of my stake pool is to earn ADA that will fund Pool of Youth; a collective—founded by myself and two other students—that is focused on elevating youth involvement in Cardano.
